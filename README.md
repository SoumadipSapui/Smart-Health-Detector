# Smart-Health-Detector
Smart Health Detector is a disease prediction system using Machine Learning models to predict and diagnose seven critical diseases: Heart Disease, Breast Cancer, Diabetes, Covid-19, Alzheimer, Brain Tumor and Pneumonia. By employing a diverse range of ML techniques tailored to the unique characteristics of each disease's data, this application aims to develop robust predictive models capable of accurate disease identification and risk assessment. For diseases with numerical data dependencies such as Heart Disease and Breast Cancer, ensemble learning methods like Random Forest and XGBoost will be employed to effectively capture complex data relationships and achieve high predictive accuracy. Conversely, image-based diseases like Covid-19 and Brain Tumor will be tackled using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), renowned for their ability to analyze medical images and detect subtle anomalies. Through rigorous data collection, model development, and validation, the Disease Prediction System endeavors to provide healthcare professionals with valuable tools for early disease detection, personalized treatment planning, and prognosis evaluation.
